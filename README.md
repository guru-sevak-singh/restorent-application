## 🔑 How It Works  
1. Customer scans the **QR code** at a restaurant table or from a delivery link.  
2. The menu is fetched dynamically from the backend.  
3. Customer selects items, adds them to the cart, and checks out.  
4. Orders are sent to the restaurant dashboard in real time.  
5. Admin confirms and forwards the order to the kitchen.
